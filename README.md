# ElectroFish_ImitationModel

The ElectroFish project is based around a fish species with an electric organ. The fish emit electric impulses used for communication and navigation. One general goal is to gain insight into the fish's social interactions. For this software project, we would like to examine the behavioural patterns of fish, both in movement and electric signalling, using Continual Learning.
 
For humans, the observed behaviour might resemble visible patterns. Both fish show different speeds, angles, or preferred locations within the tank. When defining those patterns, one can rely on low-level features like distance to the partner fish, distance to the walls, or angles between them. Or, one could observe more high-level features, including multiple timestamps like ‘following a partner fish’ or ‘circling in a corner’.
